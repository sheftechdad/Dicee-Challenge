## 🎲 Game Logic

- The dice roll is simulated by generating a random number between 1 and 6 for each player.
- After both dice rolls are generated, the game compares the values:
  - If Player 1 has a higher value, Player 1 wins.
  - If Player 2 has a higher value, Player 2 wins.
  - If both dice have the same value, it's a draw!
